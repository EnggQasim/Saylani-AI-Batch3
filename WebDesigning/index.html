    <b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy</b> 
    text of the printing and typesetting 
    industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
     
     standard dummy text ever since the <i>1500s</i>, 
     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
       leap into electronic 
      typesetting, remaining essentially 
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 
      1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
       containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
      more recently with desktop publishing 
      software like Aldus PageMaker
     including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
